# Fire Weather Sounding System

This software produces customized Skew-T Log-P plots for fire weather forecasting and analysis. The software uses a basic csv input format with the following required columns: pressure, temperature, dewpoint, u_wind, v_wind, and altitude. One can convert any sounding to this format however conversion scripts are provided for the following standard formats:
- GRAWMET

The plotting routine creates a figure with a Skew-T Log-P diagram, a hodograph, textual computed fire weather indices, custom logos, and a plot title. These parameters can be edited as needed.
